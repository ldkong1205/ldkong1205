I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore.

My research focuses on developing 3D scene understanding systems that are robust, scalable, and generalizable in real-world conditions.

🦁 I am open to discussions and collaborations in 3D scene perception, generation, and understanding. If you find our research backgrounds a potential match, feel free to email me.

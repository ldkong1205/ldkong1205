I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore.

I work in the fields of deep learning and computer vision, with particular focuses on domain adaptation, 3D perception, and visual representation learning.

My research pursues to build robust and scalable perception models that can be generalized across different domains and scenarios, with minimum or no human annotations needed.

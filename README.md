I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore.

My research pursues to build 3D perception and generation models that are robust, scalable, and generalizable across domains and scenarios, while requiring minimum human annotations.

I have been fortunate to have research attachments and internships at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/), [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), [Motional](https://motional.com/), and [ByteDance AI Lab](https://www.bytedance.com/en/).

ü¶Å I am open to discussions and collaborations in 3D scene perception and generation. Feel free to drop me an email if you find our research backgrounds a potential match.
